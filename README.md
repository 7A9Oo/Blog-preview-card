## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

in this project i learned how to use semantic html tags,
and how to create preset font and center elements to use them 


 code snippets:

```css
.center-text{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center; 
}
.preset-1{
    font-size: 24px;
    line-height: 1.5;
    letter-spacing: 0;
    font-weight: 800;
}

.preset-2{
    font-size: 16px;
    line-height: 1.5;
    letter-spacing: 0;
    font-weight: 500;
}

.preset-3{
    font-size: 14px;
    line-height: 1.5;
    letter-spacing: 0;
    font-weight: 500;
}

.preset-3-b{
    font-size: 14px;
    line-height: 1.5;
    letter-spacing: 0;
    font-weight: 800;
}
```
